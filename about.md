### Procecdures

Annual meetings will be held to exchange information, plan and coordinate activities, and review progress towards meeting the committee’s objectives. Between annual meetings, communication will take place through email, online discussion groups, and conference calls, as needed. Since all PBCC activities depend on voluntary member contributions, progress toward achieving the objectives will depend on the level of input from participants. It is envisioned that for each of the objectives a subcommittee or task force will be formed to focus on the following activities: 

### Objectives

**Objective 1: Collect, analyze, and disseminate information about U.S. public and private plant breeding efforts, including human capacity and access to enabling knowledge, technologies, germplasm, and infrastructure**

During the last cycle, PBCC initiated a partnership with the NAPB, CSSA, ASHS, ASTA, and the Seed Science Foundation (see External Linkages for acronym definitions) to survey U.S. public plant breeding capacity with regard to human capital and access to enabling knowledge, technologies, germplasm, and infrastructure. The study was designed to include components that allowed comparison with the comprehensive study of Frey (1996) and to have a methodology that is reproducible to document capacity changes over time.  The instrument that was developed currently has a database of ~350 public plant breeders and continues to grow. The survey design allows for adding new breeding programs and deleting closed programs, making it repeatable over time in order to understand capacity changes. During the next five-year period, in addition to gaining additional data points on the public sector, data will be collected to create similar information from the private sector.

While it may not be possible to generate the same level of data as with the public sector, knowing the number of private breeders, plus other demographics will be informative to understand the gaps in education. To assess private sector capacity, there are several potential mechanisms, 1) tracking the number of students who take jobs in industry 2) reaching out to research directors and asking for summary statistics of the breeding companies and 3) working with published reports on R&D.  

**Objective 2: Genetic Resources Conservation and Utilization: Promote the conservation, characterization, and utilization of plant genetic resources and access to those resources for plant breeding purposes**

PBCC will continue to coordinate with partner organizations to promote robust plant germplasm systems and initiatives, encompassing all cultivated plants within the United States; review and communicate new methods for unlocking the potential of genetic resources for crop improvement, including the use of non-elite germplasm and practices for managing data; and provide guidance on germplasm access and benefit sharing under international treaties. Coordination will be through online discussion groups where successful strategies can be shared and knowledge gaps identified. Knowledge gained from these discussion groups can be shared more broadly through white papers and co-sponsoring symposia on exploiting genetic diversity in crop improvement with organizations such as AAAS, CSSA, NAPB, ASPB, and ASHS, and/or PAG. 

**Objective 3: Explore and improve the U.S. plant breeding education capacity across 1862, 1890 and 1994 LGU and other agricultural Universities**

3a—Education-formal: Plant breeding is central to agriculture, yet there is uneven ability of land grant universities to teach all aspects of the discipline. Efforts will be made to help facilitate the development of digital courses on plant breeding relative to emerging topics such as remote phenotyping and Bayesian analysis of breeding trials. Initiatives may include:

  * Analyze and develop recommendations on core competencies for plant breeding students.
  * Survey PBCC reps to see how the core competencies are represented across agricultural universities
  * Identify need areas and establish plant breeding digital courses to address these needs
  * Recommendations on making courses etc. better available across universities (in particular those with limited capacities)
  * Develop a web tool for these competencies; white paper
  * Non-formal education options: workshops, short courses – survey; need analysis; recommendations

3b—Education-Enhance Graduate Student Training: Promote collaborative models of graduate education in plant breeding, e.g., internships at private companies or increased private support for graduate assistantships with required visits to a company site/function.

  * Develop guidelines for navigating the sometimes conflicting needs of the graduate student to publish and the private sector to protect proprietary intellectual property
  * Develop a white paper addressing the research needs of the public and private sector
  * Develop priority breeding and breeding research needs that each sector thinks the other sector should cover
  * Develop a list of projects that can be conducted in public sector but would not be pursued in the private sector which could be basis for a new set of RFPs. Examples include germplasm screening and characterization, Compositional and nutritional quality, crop breeding for food safety, etc.

3c—Education-Supporting Disciplines: Creating effective breeding teams depend on a number of scientific disciplines working collaboratively with plant breeders. While there has been a decrease in plant breeders, there has been a concomitant and sometimes larger decrease in plant breeding support (e.g. physiologists, nematologists, entomologists, statisticians) and there is an emerging need for additional data scientists.

To parallel the other components of this objective, we need to encourage more interaction between allied disciplines

  * Raising awareness other disciplines among Plant Breeders and University/Experiment station administrators
  * Identify and establish a working relationship with other Coordinating Committees from allied disciplines
  * Share programs, make meeting time available, and share research products with allied disciplines

**Objective 4: Improve communication [1] among public plant breeders and federal-state-local agencies on plant breeding policy issues, including alerts to existing and emerging threats to agricultural security that are relevant to plant breeding; and [2] among public plant breeding programs and university administrators through enhancing the mission and impact of PBCC state representatives.**

Strategy: Provide input to USDA representatives, SAES Directors, and other officials on key policy issues related to plant breeding. This will include advising on funding mechanisms and competitive grants programs, and alerting officials to emerging threats to agricultural security that are relevant to plant breeding. There is a need to develop internal communication between PBCC state reps to rapidly communicate and solicit feedback and understanding on technical and policy issues related to plant breeding. As PBCC outputs become more useful to plant breeders, there will be more interest and incentive to participate in communication efforts.

  * Collaborate with NAPB to share information with multiple audiences on the value of public plant breeding programs.
  * Help create tools for communication in different mediums (podcasting, video, visual) and different audiences (Administrators, Students, Farmers, Master Gardeners) for the plant breeding community
  * Develop templates for popular press articles, magazines
  * Develop podcasting material
  * Develop Video making training
  * Make a PBCC NIMSS project summaries available on the NAPB website
  * Develop an official PBCC letterhead with documents that are specifically directed to different audiences
  * There is a need to for PBCC to have a science editor for specific objectives that need to be communicated within and between institutions and scientific societies such as CSSA, NAPB, etc.
