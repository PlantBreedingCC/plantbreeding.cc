### Procedures

Annual meetings will be held to exchange information, plan and coordinate activities, and review progress towards meeting the committeeâ€™s objectives. Between annual meetings, communication will take place through email, online discussion groups, and conference calls, as needed. Since all PBCC activities depend on voluntary member contributions, progress toward achieving the objectives will depend on the level of input from participants. It is envisioned that for each of the objectives a subcommittee or task force will be formed to focus on the following activities: 

### Objectives

**Objective 1**: Collect, analyze, and disseminate information about U.S. public and private plant breeding efforts, including human capacity and access to enabling knowledge, technologies, germplasm, and infrastructure

**Objective 2**: Genetic Resources Conservation and Utilization: Promote the conservation, characterization, and utilization of plant genetic resources and access to those resources for plant breeding purposes

**Objective 3**: Explore and improve the U.S. plant breeding education capacity across 1862, 1890 and 1994 LGU and other agricultural Universities

**Objective 4**: Improve communication [1] among public plant breeders and federal-state-local agencies on plant breeding policy issues, including alerts to existing and emerging threats to agricultural security that are relevant to plant breeding; and [2] among public plant breeding programs and university administrators through enhancing the mission and impact of PBCC state representatives.

### Leadership

A Chair position is a one year term. Standard governance for multi-state research activities will be followed. Officers include a Chair, Vice-Chair, and Secretary. Each year at the annual meeting the Vice-Chair will become the Chair for the coming year, and the Secretary will become the Vice-Chair. Prior to the annual meeting, nominations for Secretary will be solicited and an election held by email.
